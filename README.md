**Silicon-based Civilization.** 道阻且长，行则将至

Anyway，我们必须明白，“科学”也好，“真理”也好，一切都是体系/系统。


## Introduction

- It's been years for me to think about the future of us, meanwhile there has been nothing to make me convinced that we shall go along well with the systems of humans.
- LOW energy consumption and LOW bandwidth and even LOW efficiency in transmitting effective information (between individuals and generations).
- I am always willing to resist tyranny in my life, but we must choose the direction that is correct and promising not only for us, but the children and the children's children.

## To-Do

- Try to find a min case that shall be able to help things get to run, and implement the demo.
- Init gray_draft
- Try to init white_draft
